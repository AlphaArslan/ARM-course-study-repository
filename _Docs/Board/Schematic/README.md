## Note
the schematic for our specific board seems to be missing for the official ST website.
But, I was able to get this schematic from another non-ST website:

https://www.arrow.com/en/reference-designs/nucleo-f446re-stm32-nucleo-development-board-with-stm32f446ret6-mcu-supports-arduino-and-st-morpho-connectivity/b480d6e4390793108d4bf54c6c0abfae

We just hope that it's accurate.
