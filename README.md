# ARM-course-study-repository
All assignments and notes for a Udemy course in ARM driver development

## Note
I will use [Nucleo-F446RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html) Board through this course. Please note that the instructor is using a discovery board.

This will surely have some impact on the study as my way may differ from the instructor's. You should keep an eye on the differences.
